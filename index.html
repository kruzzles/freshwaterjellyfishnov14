   <h1> PARAGRAPHS </h1>
    <h2> SECTION 1 </h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The species that I will be focusing on 
      for this project is the freshwater jellyfish (specifically the
      craspedacusta sowerbii). They have existed on earth for up to 
      600 million years, they were considered an endangered species
      in 2002. Humans hunt some edible species of jellyfish. 
      Jellyfish is used in some dishes including salads and 
      sushi however, scientists have said jellyfish are not 
      a significant item on the seafood menu as they are made
      up of 95% water and have very little calories. Even 
      though they aren't a very good source of calories 
      there are other possible benefits which include having
      important nutrients like protein and antioxidants.
      Freshwater jellyfish are very sensitive to changes
      in their environment so human interventions such as 
      pollution, changes in climate and overfishing are very 
      harmful to them. The water tempurature freshwater jellyfish 
      need to survive is 20-25°C (68-77°F.) Thermal pollution
      can greatly increase water temperature which is very
      dangerous to the jellyfish. ( write about phtoplankton dying now)
    </p>
    
    <h2> SECTION 2 </h2>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is very little biological
       diversity in freshwater jellyfish. This is because the
       predators they have are often hunted.
